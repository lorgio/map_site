    <richText>And I&#x2019;m a Registered Republican....as of today.  I KNOW I KNOW, from everyone that knows me I have not gone crazy.  and please don&#x2019;t IM me &#x201C;we're not friends anymore - 9 years down the drain in an instant!&#x201D; There is a method to this madness.  I did this to vote for Ron Paul for the NY Republican Primary.  This is hopefully my small step, along with a monetary contribution, to make Dr. Paul, the Republican Candidate.  If he does become the Candidate, I will vote for him for president.  His record is a mirror image of what he preaches, unlike every single other candidate on their soapboxes made of money from lobbyists.&#xD;&#xD;</richText>
