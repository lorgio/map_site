    <richText>So I have Oracle training in the city this week, and I can either take the E train all the way in or take the LIRR and THEN the E Train up to 53rd and 5th.  Today I decided to take the LIRR and then the E up.  First off, I couldn&#x2019;t even get on the platform at Penn for the E. I had to wait to get TO the turnstile.  Then the trains, which are packed like sardines, were insane.  I don&#x2019;t know how bloomberg thinks he&#x2019;s going to be able to tax people to drive into midtown and force them to use public transportation</richText>
